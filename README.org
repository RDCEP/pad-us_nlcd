*** TODO Add more detail to codeset description.

This repository is an example of a Blox component.  Blox is a modular
source code management, data management and scientific workflow
concept under development at the University of Chicago's Computation
Institute.  Blox currently relies on the Git distributed version
control system and GNU Make, but could conceivably be implemented
using other source code management systems and dependency tracking
utilities.
